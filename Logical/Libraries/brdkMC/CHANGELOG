## [2.2.1] - 2017-04-24

### Fixed
- configuration.ignoreSwLimit not always writing to parID 128 (SGEN_SW_END_IGNORE), and in some cases sw end limits were still active


## [2.2.0] - 2017-02-06

### Fixed
- RTinfo FUB cyclic call only until task cyletime is found, this reduces the total CPU load for the brdkMC FUB call.

### Changed
- status.torque.actual, status.torque.peak, status.torque.continous is now no longer showed as an absolute value. This provides the information if the motor torque is negative or positive. 

### Fixed
- Read motor and drive info not ok, if ACOPOS drive is rebooted.


## [2.1.4] - 2016-12-15

### Fixed
- status.inMotion would be set high shortly when powering off in STANDSTILL. This due to CMD_QUICKSTOP automatically set by the MC_Power FUB when powering off.


## [2.1.3] - 2016-09-02

### Fixed
- status.inMotion could in rare occations not represent the correct status for the axis.


## [2.1.2] - 2016-08-25

### Fixed
- cyclic read functionblocks was not reset if communication was lost to the drive. Functionblock got stuck in ST_ERROR.
- encoder status is reset if battery warning bit is set. Should only reset if alarm bit is set.


## [2.1.1] - 2016-06-03

### Fixed
- commands jog positive and jog negative could not interrupt each other and change direction


## [2.1.0] - 2016-04-08

### Added

## [2.0.1] - 2016-03-17

### Fixed
- command.gearOut was not sending the state to ST_GEAR_OUT, so status.done was never set for this command
